# MQTT_NodeJSAndMYSQL
I made an MQTT project Backend side with using NodeJS and MYSQL first time in my life. Nodejs and MYSQL is really affective and impresive for me. Because even it is first time for me to use this technology after making some search I easily adapted and made such a great MQTT Project Backend Side. This project is just an beginning for me.

## Setup

- Install Visual Studio 2019
- npm i moca mqtt mysql
- After that you should setup your mysql environment
- Then you should make it run one by one
- if you get validator error when you run node broker
- then comment inside if statement line 110
- if (...) {
    //throw new SchemaError('Expected `schema` to be an object or boolean');
  }
- Like node broker | node subscribe | node publisher
- After a while close publisher one then subscribe one finally broker one
